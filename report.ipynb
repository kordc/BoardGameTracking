    "This game is for 2-4 players, we similated the game for 3 players. The game is played on board, which can be divided into 2 parts - left, where every player has to bet some money for chosen god, and right, where the game is played. The game is played in turns, where every player can do one of the following actions:\n",

    "* Fight with other player\n",
    "* Place cities on the board\n",

    "We decided to record movies with 3 levels of difficulty. It turned out, that even the first one is very hard, corresponding to the level 3 in the project description. There we have an angled view of the board, static camera view and sometimes we cover elements by hand. The second level is harder, as it introduces slightly different angle and different light conditions (random shadows). The third one is almost impossible to process, because we have there a dynamic camera view with a acute angle and random shadows. We also have a lot of objects on the board, which makes it even harder to track.\n",
